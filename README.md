# Productive Task Manager
This is a full-stack, a web application designed to help you manage your tasks and boost your productivity. The app combines a modern, responsive front-end with a robust back-end, offering a seamless user experience.

# Features
Full-Stack To-Do App: A complete task management system where you can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them from your list. All changes are saved in a database for persistence.

Secure Authentication: Users can securely sign up and log in to the application. Authentication is managed using sessions and cookies, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.

Persistent Data Storage: All your tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, with data modeling handled by Mongoose. This guarantees that your data is saved and accessible across different sessions.

Customizable Themes: The application includes a feature to change the theme, with your preference saved in localStorage so your settings are remembered for future visits.

Integrated Chatbot Assistant: A powerful chatbot is integrated into the application to act as your personal assistant. The chatbot, powered by the Gemini API, can provide helpful advice on time management and productivity.

API Documentation: The backend API is fully documented using Swagger, making it easy for other developers to understand and interact with the server's endpoints.
